Create a Python {{List}} {{hard}} quiz with multiple-choice questions, each having four options and one correct answer. The quiz should cover fundamental concepts of Python programming related to {{list manipulation}}. Each question should be structured as a dictionary containing the question, options, and the correct answer. If any question involves code, include the code snippet in a separate key. Finally, convert the entire quiz into a JSON format for easy access and distribution.
